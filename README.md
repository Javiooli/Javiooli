- I'm Javiooli, an 19 years old IT Engineer student in Universitat de Barcelona.
- I'm interested in videogames but in a more technical way. What I enjoy when playing is the technicity more than the gameplay or graphics themselves.
- Currently I'm at my first year, learning C++, Java, Python and VHDL.
- My goal is to end up researching and developing new hardware.
- My Instagram account is @Javiooli, as most of my other social medias.
